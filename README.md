# Graph Neural Networks for Hardness Estimation in Robotic Tactile Palpation

This repository contains the code developed for my MSc project on **Graph Neural Networks for Hardness Estimation in Robotic Tactile Palpation**.  
The project explores the use of **vision-based tactile sensing** with the **ViTacTip sensor** and **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to estimate material hardness.  
The ultimate goal is to apply this pipeline for **localising stiff regions in tissue** as a step toward tumour detection.

## ðŸ“Š Results

1) GINEConv achieved RÂ² = 0.69, outperforming both GCN and CNN+LSTM baselines.

2) The model effectively captures the relationship between deformation fields and material hardness.

3) This approach provides a proof of concept for applying GNNs to infer physical properties which can be useful for tumour detection.
